# Welcome to my GitHub profile. Thank you for visiting!

## I am a web developer, artist and teacher. I enjoy exporing and inhabiting the interfaces where varied realms of knowledge and making meet and fertilze one another. I have studied programming, practiced ancient Egyptian and Medieval art techniques, taught fairy tales and philosophy.
